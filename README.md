# Application Icons for Microsoft Intune

A set of application icons for Windows, macOS, Android and iOS platforms for use when adding applications to Microsoft Intune or Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (or other device management / MDM and application deployment solutions).

Icons have been added in their largest size and best possible quality. All icons have been optimised for size using [PNGOUT](http://advsys.net/ken/util/pngout.htm). Icons are optimised and converted to PNG format by scripts run by AppVeyor builds. All non-PNG files are then removed from the icons folder in the repository and pushed back to GitHub.

## Usage

Self-service applications are displayed in the Intune Company Portal app or at the [Microsoft Intune Web Company Portal](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com/) for install. Using high quality product icons ensures users see a familiar interface when accessing these applications.
